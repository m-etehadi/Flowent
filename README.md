# Flowent
Fluent builder to build a command object


# Road map:
	1. Add async execution support
	2. Add cancelation token
	3. Get and run handlers by PreDefined Interfaces in Run Method
	4. Get and run handlers by reflection 			 in Run Method
	5. Get and run handlers by CustomAttributes 	 in Run Method
	6. Use command builder in .net core containers
	7. Use command builder in MediatR
